# OOP-school-library
Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, 
and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. 
The app that I create will allow a you to:

- Add new students or teachers.
- Add new books.
- Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.
